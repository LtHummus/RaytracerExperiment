# Raytracer Experiment

This is an experimental ray tracer. I don't mean it uses some experimental rendering or anything like that, it's just that I wrote it as an experiment.

It's slow, and probably shouldn't be used generally, but it was fun to work on. Some of the code is still a bit messy, but it does work. An example scene definition file can be found in the `samples` directory.

Most (ok, basically all) the credit goes to [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) book for getting me this far (and of course Google).
